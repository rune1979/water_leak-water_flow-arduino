# water_leak water_flow arduino
<h2>Non invasive flow meter and leak detector</h2>
<p>This is an atempt to make a small Arduino/Microcontroled unit, to make leak detection and not least flow estimation. The unit in this case is making use of a Bluetooth Low Energy module, which is probably the most costly part of the unit. Besides the Arduino (Nano in this case), BLE module, we also make use of 3 thermistors.</p>

<p>The price should in general be posible to keep well below $50 
  <li>- Adafruit Bluefruit LE UART Friend = $17.50</li>
  <li>- Arduino Nano (copy) = aprox. $4</li>
  <li>- 3 thermistors = aprox. $3</li>
</p>
<p>If you want a complet solution, with battery charging capabilities and everything in one solution. Then Adafruits Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE to $29.95 is probably a good choose. There are also other options, like boards with LoRaWAN, GSM etc. that could make sense for you.</p>
